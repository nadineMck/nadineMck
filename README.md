## 🌱 Projects

### Feel-The-Flow - Dynamic Sound from Motion
- Developed a system that generates dynamic music based on real-time or pre-recorded motion
  data from sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes
- Motion-to-Music Mapping: Converts motion data into musical elements like melody, chords,
  and rhythm, reflecting movement intensity and patterns
- Integrated custom chord progressions that adapt to the intensity of motion, offering a wide
  range of musical scales
- Provides visualizations of both the motion data (accelerometer/gyroscope) and the spectrogram
  of the generated music
  
### FlutterForecast - Locust Detection Platform
- Led ML team in developing a platform for NGOs and farmers
- Utilized NASA's PriThvi-100M geospatial model
- Implemented advanced image processing techniques on satellite imagery

### TestSuite - Automated Testing Tool
